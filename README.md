## G Engine
I'd rather use Vulkan than OpenGL. \
Gangster engine (i think)

## Build
Use your POSIX shell or something.
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. # -G Ninja
cmake --build .
```

## One more thing
Oh yeah, and you need the following devel libraries installed: **Vulkan, GLFW, GLM** \
I have no clue what platform you're on so figure it out.
